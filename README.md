## ⚙️ Installation  
### 1. Download the script 
Download and execute the script. 
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AL-CALL-LLC/KamailioBuilder/refs/heads/main/kamailio_install.sh
chmod +x kamailio_install.sh
./kamailio_install.sh
```

### 2. Update your PATH if ```kamailio``` Command doesn't work directly
After installation, ensure Kamailio is available in your shell's environment:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
Alternatively, run the script in the current shell session:
```bash
. kamailio_install.sh
```

---

## 🧩 Command Line Options
The script supports several command-line options to customize the installation:

```bash
Usage: ./kamailio_install.sh [options]

Options:
  -h, --help              Display this help message
  -sip, --sip-domain      Specify the SIP domain (ex: -sip sip.example.com)
  -y, --yes               Automatically answer 'yes' to all questions
  -v, --version           Display kamailio version that will be installed
  --show-modules          Display default modules (db_mysql, tls) and additional modules available for         installation
```

### Examples:
```bash
# Display help
./kamailio_install.sh -h

# Install with specific SIP domain
./kamailio_install.sh -sip example.com

# Non-interactive installation
./kamailio_install.sh -y -sip example.com

# Show available modules
./kamailio_install.sh --show-modules

# Display kamailio version that will be installed
./kamailio_install.sh -v
```

## 🧩 How It Works  
The script automates the following tasks:  
1. **System Checks**:  
   Verifies root privileges, system compatibility, and existing installations.  

2. **Dependency Installation**:  
   Installs required packages like `gcc`, `make`, and `libssl-dev`.  

3. **Source Code Management**:  
   Downloads and updates Kamailio's source code from its Git repository.  

4. **Compilation and Installation**:  
   Builds and installs Kamailio with modules like `db_mysql` and `tls`.  

5. **Database Setup**:  
   Configures MySQL for Kamailio's database requirements.  

6. **Systemd Configuration**:  
   Sets up Kamailio as a service managed by `systemd`.  

7. **User Management**:  
   Adds a test user with a randomly generated secure password.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting  
If you encounter issues:  
1. **Ensure your system meets all prerequisites.**  
2. **Check the output logs for specific errors.**
